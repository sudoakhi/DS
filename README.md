## Introduction

Data structures are fundamental building blocks used in software development to store and organize data efficiently. Understanding data structures and their implementations is crucial for writing optimized algorithms and creating high-performance applications.

This repository aims to provide clear and concise implementations of various data structures in C#. Each data structure is accompanied by explanations, usage examples, and performance analysis where applicable.

## Data Structures Implemented

The following data structures are currently implemented in this repository:

- **Linked List**: A linear data structure where elements are linked using pointers.
- **Binary Tree**: A hierarchical data structure where each node has at most two children.
- **Binary Search Tree**: A binary tree in which the left child contains only nodes with values less than the parent node, and the right child contains only nodes with values greater than the parent node
- **Graph**: A collection of nodes (vertices) and edges that connect pairs of nodes.
- **Trie**: Implementation of Prefix and Suffix Trie.

## Explore

Each data structure classes are implemented in it's directory. Please use Runner class located in each directory to test and validate
